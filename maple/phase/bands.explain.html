 This shows the system with $\dot{x}=1$ and $\dot{y}=\sin(\pi y)$.  As
 $\dot{x}$ is never zero, there are no equilibrium points.  It is
 clear that $x=x_0+t$, but the behaviour of $y$ is less obvious.  For
 any integer $n$ we have a solution $(x,y)=(t,n)$ (which works because
 $\dot{y}=0$ and also $\sin(\pi y)=\sin(n\pi)=0$).  If $0 < y < 1$ then
 $\dot{y}=\sin(\pi y)>0$ so $y$ increases, but solutions never cross
 so $(x,y)$ must stay below $y=1$.  In fact we find that $y$ increases
 asymptotically, tending towards the limit $y=1$ but never reaching
 it.  Similarly, if $1 < y < 2$ then $y$ decreases asymptotically towards
 $y=1$.
