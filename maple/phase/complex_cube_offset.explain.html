 It is best to understand these equations using the complex variable
 $z=x+iy$, so $x=\text{Re}(z)$ and $y=\text{Im}(z)$.  We have
 \begin{align*}
  \dot{x} &= x^3-3xy^2-1 = \text{Re}(z^3-1) \\
  \dot{y} &= 3x^2y-y^3 = \text{Im}(z^3-1) \\
  \dot{z} &= z^3-1 = x^3 + 3x^2yi - 3xy^2 - y^3i.
 \end{align*}
 To understand the nullclines, it is useful to consider the number 
 $$ \omega = e^{2\pi i/3} = (\sqrt{3}i-1)/2, $$ 
 and to note that $\omega^3=1$, so that $(\omega z)^3-1=z^3-1$.  The
 point $\omega z$ is obtained by rotating the point $z$ through an
 angle of $2\pi/3$ around the origin.
 <br/><br/>
 The $y$-nullcline consists of points $z\in\mathbb{C}$ where 
 $z^3-1$ is real, or equivalently $z^3$ is real, or equivalently $z$
 is real or is a real multiple of $\omega$ or $\overline{\omega}$.
 Thus, the $y$-nullcline consists of three straight lines through the
 origin.
 <br/><br/>
 The $x$-nullcline consists of points $z$ where $z^3-1$ is purely
 imaginary, say $z^3=1+is$ for some $s\in\mathbb{R}$.  This means that
 $z$ is $(1+is)^{1/3}$ or $\omega(1+is)^{1/3}$ or
 $\overline{\omega}(1+is)^{1/3}$. 
 <br/><br/>
 The equilibrium points are the points $z$ where $z^3=1$, which are
 $1$, $\omega$ and $\overline{\omega}$.
