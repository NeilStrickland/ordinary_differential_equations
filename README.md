# Ordinary differential equations

This repository contains material for a second course on ordinary differential equations.  The first half is about ODEs in the plane, focussing on phase portraits, linearisation and stability.  The second half is about second order linear ODEs including power series methods and Sturm-Liouville theory.

* Lecture slides: [screen version](lectures/all_lectures.pdf) and [print version](lectures/all_handouts.pdf)
* [Problems and solutions](probs/all_probs.pdf)
* [Exam questions and solutions](exams/all_questions.pdf)
* Some additional [notes](notes) (but the lecture slides are the primary content)
* [Interactive diagrams](web/index.html), mostly of phase portraits of various plane ODEs
* [Maple worksheets](maple).  These are used to generate the pictures in the lecture slides etc, and also some of the content in the interactive diagrams.
